# IntelliDocs AI – Multi-Agent Document Intelligence Platform (Agentic AI + RAG)

## Overview

IntelliDocs AI is an advanced Multi-Agent Document Intelligence Platform that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Agentic AI workflows to enable intelligent document understanding and contextual question answering.

The platform allows users to upload and analyze PDF, DOCX, TXT, and CSV documents, perform semantic search using vector embeddings, and receive verified, citation-backed answers generated through a collaborative multi-agent pipeline orchestrated by LangGraph.

## Key Features

### Multi-Agent AI Workflow

The system uses four specialized AI agents:

#### Retrieval Agent

* Retrieves the most relevant document chunks from the FAISS vector database.
* Scores and ranks document relevance.

#### Summarization Agent

* Synthesizes retrieved content.
* Removes redundant information.
* Produces concise context for downstream processing.

#### Fact Verification Agent

* Verifies claims against original document sources.
* Detects unsupported information.
* Reduces hallucinations.

#### Answer Generation Agent

* Generates final responses.
* Incorporates verified context and conversation history.
* Provides source citations.

## Example Workflow

1. Upload a PDF document.
2. System extracts and indexes content.
3. Embeddings are generated and stored in FAISS.
4. User asks a question.
5. Multi-Agent workflow executes:

   * Retrieval Agent
   * Summarization Agent
   * Verification Agent
   * Generation Agent
6. Verified answer with citations is displayed.
